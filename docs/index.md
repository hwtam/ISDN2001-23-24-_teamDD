02/11
- changed the topic to showing occupancy of minibus to passengers(the current topic)(final)

07/11
- weekly 2001 meeting, plan to interview KMB, Saikung Minibus Operator, Pulse, USTransit

11/12
- decide to use youtube video instead of renting a minibus for the testing of people counting

12/12
- Matt designed the UI of SpeeDD(the product/software)

15/12

## Simulation prototype log
### [Github commit log here](https://github.com/hwtam/ISDN2001-teamDD/commits)

27/11
- make a [model](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF1U-2nVa4/tthAYAMsnmWHyW39IpZPLQ/edit) to sort out the relationship of different parameters of the simulation

29/12
- find the minibus ETA api

06/12
- basic planning for the simulation prototype(Jimmy&Tom)
- Jimmy and I done the [code for getting the ETA of minibus](https://github.com/hwtam/ISDN2001-teamDD/blob/simulation_v5/data_collection/eta.py)

07/12
- Used the ETA of 11M to predict the time needed to arrival each stop

09/12
- Done [v1](https://github.com/hwtam/ISDN2001-teamDD/tree/simulation_v1), to show the simulation process in terminal, for testing purpose
- Done the basic simulation algorithm
- Done [v2](https://github.com/hwtam/ISDN2001-teamDD/tree/simulation_v2), to store the simulation process data to a excel file, for manually generating graph in excel to visualize  the data

10/12
- Matt designed the UI for the simulation
![UI.jpg](UI.jpg)

13/12
- Done [v3](https://github.com/hwtam/ISDN2001-teamDD/tree/simulation_v3), to visualize  the simulation using pygame for a better GUI and interaction, for demo purpose

15/12
- Done v4(merged into v5), the color of stop/people count changes in different states to help visualize  the data
- Done [v5](https://github.com/hwtam/ISDN2001-teamDD/tree/simulation_v5)(the current version), based on v4 but with an even better interaction design, able to click on minibus/stop to show a graph for visualizing the data

I want to focus on prediction
- Predict when will the passenger get on the minibus
- Suggest whichÂ transportation to take for the passenger

Possible direction
- designing algorithm to predict the traffic and for the suggestion
- make use of AI model to predict the traffic based on historic data and for the suggestion
